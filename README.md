Hi I am Sanjoy Dey. I am passionate about web technologies. After enjoying couple of MVC frameworks and 
nearly 1 years of gained knowledge by creating small MVC, I started creating Cygnite Framework around 2012.
Cygnite Framework will give you creative experience with expressive performance and user friendly architecture 
to reduce your development time.

Cygnite is currently in development stage (v1.0.5) and contributions to Cygnite development would be highly appreciated.
